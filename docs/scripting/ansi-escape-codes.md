## Documentation on ANSI Escape Codes for cursor and screen manipulation

```text
ESC [ = 0x9B = CSI (Control Sequence Introducer)
Starts most of the useful sequences, terminated by a byte in the range 0x40 through 0x7E.[5]:‚Ää5.4
```

```text
CSI n A = CUU (Cursor Up)
Moves the cursor n (default 1) cells in the given direction. If the cursor is already at the edge of the screen, this has no effect.
```

```text
CSI n J = ED (Erase in Display
Clears part of the screen. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to end of screen. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the screen. If n is 2, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS ANSI.SYS). If n is 3, clear entire screen and delete all lines saved in the scrollback buffer (this feature was added for xterm and is supported by other terminal applications).
```

```text
CSI n K = EL (Erase in Line)
Erases part of the line. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to the end of the line. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the line. If n is 2, clear entire line. Cursor position does not change.
```

```text
CSI n F = CPL (Cursor Previous Line)
Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines up. (not ANSI.SYS)
```

```text
CSI n G = CHA (Cursor Horizontal Absolute)
Moves the cursor to column n (default 1). (not ANSI.SYS)
```

-   `\e[A` = move the cursor up 1 line
-   `\e[1K` = clear from cursor to beginning of the line
-   `\e[2K` = clear entire line
-   `\e[G` = moves the cursor to column 1
-   `\e[F` = Moves cursor to beginning of 1 lines up
-   `\e[J` = clear from cursor to end of screen
-   `$'\e[?47h'` = save screen but not cursor
-   `$'\e[?47l'` = restore screen but not cursor
-   `tput sc` = `$'\e7'` = save cursor, `$'\e[s'` is meant to work but from testing it doesn't
-   `tput rc` = `$'\e8'` = restore cursor, `$'\e[u'` is meant to work but from testing it doesn't
-   `tput smcup` = `$'\e[?1049h'` = save screen and cursor
-   `tput rmcup` = `$'\e[?1049l'` = restore screen and cursor
-   `tput clear` = `$'\e[H\e[2J'` = put cursor at top left and clear the screen
-   `tput cup 0 0` = `$'\e[1;1H'` = put cursor at top left, functionally same as `$'\e[H'`
