# Prompts

A few different tools exist in Dorothy for doing fancy TTY stuff:

-   For creating alternative TTYs (which is necessary for when the content to be "erased" may span the terminal window's height):

    -   `sources/tty.bash` which is what `ask` and `choose-menu` uses
        -   `choose-option` uses `choose-menu`, and `ask` also uses `choose-option` for confirmations

-   For erasing only certain lines (which only works when the content to be "erased" is within the terminal widow's height):

    -   `echo-revolving-door` only shows the revolving last line, erasing prior lines as output is being generated
    -   `echo-clear-line`, `echo-clear-lines` erase prior lines
    -   `eval-collapse` (which is used by `setup-util`) uses `echo-revolving-door` for the executing command, and `echo-clear-lines` for cleaning up headers for producing summary outputs

-   For custom cursor magic:

    -   `confirm` uses the TTY ANSI codes directly to move the cursor to first line of the prompt, then to erase and clean up afterwards and during

-   For colors:

    -   `echo-style` does the magic
