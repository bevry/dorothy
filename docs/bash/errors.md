# Errors

## Naming and Numbering

In Bash, functions can return a number, commands can exit with a number, and processes can receive numbers.
These numbers represent an exit status, also known as exit codes, return codes, error codes, etc.
When scripting, an exit status of 0 is considered a success, in which execution will continue, and a non-zero exist status is considered a failure which will cause execution to stop unless manually discarded.

When returning any non-zero exit status, you should attempt to use a meaningful exit status, and note it's meaning like so:

```bash
return 2 # ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
```

To select an exit status, refer to the following sources:

### Signals

For exit statuses 128-199 these are signals sent by the `kill` command, which may or may not cause an exit status. If an exit status is returned, then it uses the formula 128 + signal number. Why 128? 128 is the signal used by `kill` to check if a process is with a given PID exists.

The [GNU `coreutils` specification](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Signal-specifications.html) defines the following:

```plain
The following signal names and numbers are supported on all POSIX compliant systems:

1. SIGHUP: Hangup  [Exit Status: 128 + 1 = 129]
2. SIGINT: Terminal interrupt  [Exit Status: 128 + 2 = 130]
3. SIGQUIT: Terminal quit  [Exit Status: 128 + 3 = 131]
6. SIGABRT: Process abort  [Exit Status: 128 + 6 = 134]
9. SIGKILL: Kill (cannot be caught or ignored)  [Exit Status: 128 + 9 = 137]
14. SIGALRM: Alarm Clock  [Exit Status: 128 + 14 = 142]
15. SIGTERM: Termination  [Exit Status: 128 + 15 = 143]

Other supported signal names have system-dependent corresponding numbers. All systems conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001 also support the following signals [exit statuses vary]:

SIGBUS: Access to an undefined portion of a memory object
SIGCHLD: Child process terminated, stopped, or continued
SIGCONT: Continue executing, if stopped
SIGFPE: Erroneous arithmetic operation
SIGILL: Illegal Instruction
SIGPIPE: Write on a pipe with no one to read it
SIGSEGV: Invalid memory reference
SIGSTOP: Stop executing (cannot be caught or ignored)
SIGTSTP: Terminal stop
SIGTTIN: Background process attempting read
SIGTTOU: Background process attempting write
SIGURG: High bandwidth data is available at a socket
SIGUSR1: User-defined signal 1
SIGUSR2: User-defined signal 2

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XSI extension also support the following signals [exit statuses vary]:

SIGPOLL: Pollable event
SIGPROF: Profiling timer expired
SIGSYS: Bad system call
SIGTRAP: Trace/breakpoint trap
SIGVTALRM: Virtual timer expired
SIGXCPU: CPU time limit exceeded
SIGXFSZ: File size limit exceeded

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XRT extension also support at least eight real-time signals called ‘RTMIN’, ‘RTMIN+1’, …, ‘RTMAX-1’, ‘RTMAX’.
```

### dorothy

For exit statuses 200-255, these are non-conventional as such they permit our own usage, in which Dorothy has used the following:

```plain
ECUSTOM 200 Not applicable <for reason>
Used to signal the caller that the action was not performed, and might be fine because the action wasn't applicable.

ECUSTOM 210 Processing complete, exit early
```

## Invocation and Capturing

In Bash, any invocation of a function within a conditional (`!`, `if`, `&&`, `||`) will invoke the function with `errexit` (aka `set -e`) disabled.
This unfortunately cannot be disabled, and is a legacy decision from bash's prior primary use as a login shell, rather than a scripting language.
It causes the following unexpected behaviour:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# our standard failure functions, these will be used by our examples
function a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command {
	echo 'before failure'
	false # emit an error to this function, as this returns a non-zero exit status
	echo 'after failure'
}
function a_function_which_failure_IS_the_last_command {
	echo 'before failure without after'
	false # emit an error to this function, as this returns a non-zero exit status
}


# select an example, either by modifying "1", or by saving this a script and using the first argument
example="${1:-"1"}"
case "$example" in
# these examples are as expected
1)
	set +e # disable errors returning immediately, the default bash mode, desirable for the login shell
	a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command
	# outputs:
	# before failure
	# after failure
	;;
2)
	set -e # enable errors to return immediately, the default bash mode in dorothy enabled when we `source "$DOROTHY/sources/bash.bash"`, desirable for scripting
	a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command
    # outputs:
	# before failure
	;;

# however these don't
3)
	set -e
	! a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command
	echo 'failure'
	# outputs:
	# before failure
	# after failure
	;;
4)
	set -e
	a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command && echo 'success'
	# outputs:
	# before failure
	# after failure
	# success
	;;
5)
	set -e
	a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command || echo 'failure'
    # outputs:
	# before failure
	# after failure
	;;
6)
	set -e
	if a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command; then
		echo 'success'
	else
		echo 'failure'
	fi
	# outputs:
	# before failure
	# after failure
	# success
	;;
7)
	set -e
	if ! a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command; then
		echo 'failure'
	else
		echo 'success'
	fi
	# outputs:
	# before failure
	# after failure
	# success
	;;

# if the failure is the last command, then such works as expected, as the exit status of any function is always the exit status of the last executed command, regardless of errexit
8)
	set -e
	a_function_which_failure_IS_the_last_command && echo 'success' || echo 'failure'
	echo 'ok'
	# outputs:
	# before failure without after
	# failure
	# ok
	;;

# this behaviour also impacts how we fetch exit codes
9)
    # without errexit
    set +e
    a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command
    echo "status=$?"
    # outputs:
    # before failure
    # after failure
    # status=0
    a_function_which_failure_IS_the_last_command
    echo "status=$?"
    # outputs:
    # before failure without after
    # status=1
    ;;
10)
    # with errexit
    set -e
    status=0 && a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command || status=$?
    echo "status=$status"
    # outputs:
    # before failure
    # after failure
    # status=0
    status=0 && a_function_which_failure_IS_the_last_command || status=$?
    echo "status=$status"
    # outputs:
    # before failure without after
    # status=1
    ;;
esac
```

Official guidance from the bash community is to either abandon `errexit` and place `|| return` on every single line, or use `errexit` and implement a workaround for when invoking functions.

Dorothy has such a workaround, which is `eval_capture` and is provided by placing `source "$DOROTHY/sources/bash.bash"` at the beginning of your command, and is used like so:

```bash
local status=0 stdout='' stderr='' output=''
eval_capture [--statusvar=status] [--stdoutvar=stdout] [--stderrvar=stderr] [--outputvar=output] [--] cmd ...
```

Which is implemented like so:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source "$DOROTHY/sources/bash.bash" # enables errexit and provides eval_capture

# capturing exit status
# before
status=0 && some_function || status=$?
# after
status=0
eval_capture --statusvar=status a_function_which_failure_IS_NOT_the_last_command

# ignoring exit status
# before
some_function || :
# after
eval_capture some_function

# acting upon success or failure
# before
if some_function; then
	# ...
else
	# ...
fi
# after
local status
eval_capture --statusvar=status some_function
if test "$status" -eq 0; then
	# ...
else
	# ...
fi

# negating exit status
# before
! some_function
# after
local status
eval_capture --statusvar=status some_function
if test "$status" -ne 0; then
    # ...
fi

# ignoring exit status inside interpolation
# before
local result
result="$(some_function || :)"
# after
local result
eval_capture --stdoutvar=result some_function
```

If for whatever reason you do decide to not use eval_capture, then prefix the function with two underscores (`__`) to indicate it is safe for `if`, `and`, `or`, `not` operations, and make sure every invocation statement is suffixed with `|| return`.
