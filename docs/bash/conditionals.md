Advice:

-   `-z` is empty string: True if the length of string is zero.
-   `-n` is string: True if the length of string is nonzero.
-   `-e` is file or directory.
-   `-d` is dir: True if file exists and is a directory.
-   `-f` is file: True if file exists and is a regular file.
-   `-s` is nonempty file: True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.
-   `=` is equal: True if the strings s1 and s2 are identical.

## `[[` and `]]`

-   [Stack Exchange: Why does this bash conditional check work with `[[ -n .. ]]` but not `[ -n .. ]`?](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/246320/50703)

Only useful if doing `[[ blah = *blah* ]]` or the like.
