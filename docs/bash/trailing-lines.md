# Mastering Trailing Lines in Bash

Advice:

```bash
# fails to output trailing line:
printf $'a\nb\nc' | while read -r line; do
	echo "[$line]"
done
# [a]
# [b]

# outputs correctly, including the trailing line:
printf $'a\nb\nc' | while read -r line || test -n "$line"; do
	echo "[$line]"
done
# [a]
# [b]
# [c]

# note that <<< works as expected
while read -r line; do
	echo "[$line]"
done <<< $'a\nb\nc'
# [a]
# [b]
# [c]

# but < <( does not
while read -r line; do
	echo "[$line]"
done < <(printf $'a\nb\nc')
# [a]
# [b]
```
