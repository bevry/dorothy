# UASP supported is needed by the USB Hubs for UASP boost, as stated by StarTech in a support chat:
# > All hubs support the use of UASP enabled devices, but hubs that do not have the feature built in will not operate at the boosted speed that UASP devices can function at. If you require the UASP boosted speed, then look for a hub that has it built in. If the speed is not crucial and the standard 5Gbps that USB 3.0 offers will suffice, it won't matter the hub you use as long as its a USB 3.0 hub.
