	# send an ansi query to fetch the cursor line and column, returns [^[[24;80R] where 24 is line/row/y, 80 is column/x
	# use _ to discard, the first read var is garbage, the second read var is the line, the final read var is the column
	# use a 2 second timeout, as otherwise on macos sonoma will wait forever
	# shorter timeouts aren't suitable as slower machines take a while for the response
	# the read will complete immediately upon a response thanks to [-d R] which completes reading when the R is read, which is the final character of the response
