			Dorothy extends the brew command to:
			- enforce the correct prefix on macOS and Linux via [HOMEBREW_PREFIX = ${HOMEBREW_PREFIX-}]
			    - this ensures brew invokes homebrew, even when PATH is incorrect and when default brew is not homebrew
			- enforce the appropriate architecture on macOS via [HOMEBREW_ARCH = ${HOMEBREW_ARCH-}]

			Dorothy shell environments are configured to:
			- ensure all homebrew environment variables are configured correctly
			- disable auto updates on macOS, as Dorothy handles that better via [setup-mac-brew]
			- disable brew environment hints, as Dorothy handles that better via [setup-environment-commands]
